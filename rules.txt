<h2> =] Troller rules: </h2>

<p>Since this is platform created for flame wars we will have a minimum amount of rules. Besides no one likes to read long walls of texts.</p>

1) You won't take any legal action towards ANYONE (not the commenters, not the site owner). This platform was made for fun, take your real life frustrations elsewhere.

2) Advertising is prohibited. Any kind of advertising in the way help me reach xxxx amount of views on this and this (youtube video, site, whatever) is prohibited. Violators will be banned immediately. Nobody cares about your video on commenting platform.

3) While posting a link to image that belongs to other site is allowed if the main purpose of the image is to invoke a discussion between the commenters. Cute animals, cat in boxes images/gifs are not welcome here. Shove them up your ass and move to 9.fag instead. The main purpose of this site is to get away of those so called "fun" sites which are not fun at all anymore.

4) Post discussions in the correct Category. 

5) Anyone that will act like one of the Troller staff will be banned immediately. Troller staff got red usernames, while normal users got blue.

6) Troller staff got right to edit, delete, lock any content on site without further notice.







7) With checking the button "I agree with the rules of this site", you sold us your soul. Clicking on that button is not necessary, it's just there to see who reads the rules and who doesn't.


For using this commenting platform you still have to respect first 6 rules.
